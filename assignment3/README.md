I brainstormed different ways to measure time and landed on the fermentation process. Initially, I wanted to do kimchi but thought that kombucha would be better to identify and visualize, specifically the changing of the color of the liquid as time passes.

Kombucha goes through 2 fermnetation processes. The first fermentation process typically takes 7-12 days, though some people might go longer. During this time, the sweet tea ferments and is transformed into kombucha by the starter tea and kombucha culture. At the end, it will be an unflavored, un-carbonated kombucha. In the second round, the kombucha is flavored with fruit usually and bottled in a sealed container for around 2-4 days to creat carbonation.

- seconds - bubbles floating to the top
- minutes - the liquid gets lighter as minutes pass 
- hours - changing of the background from day to night
- sun to moon
