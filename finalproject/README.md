Nervous System
- Central Nervous System
- Periperal Nervous System
  - somatic nervous system (voluntary control)
  - automatic nervous system (automatic control)
    - sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight)
    - parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest, calm state)

Breathwork reduces stress and anxiety, improves mood, and increases mindfulness.
It grounds people when they're feeling anxious and informs their nervous system they are safe.
Breathing increases your energy levels and boosts your immune system by bringing in more oxygen,
which fuels the cells that keep us healthy and energized.

It stimulates the vagus nerve, which regulates the relaxation response. It also improves
emotional regulation, increasing the heart rate variability, which is associated with better handling of stress
and reduced reactivity. It also reduces cortisol and quiets the mind, improving sleep quality.

Regular breathwork strengthens your respiratory function, increasing diaphragm strength.
