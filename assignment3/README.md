I brainstormed different ways to measure time and landed on the fermentation process. Initially, I wanted to do kimchi but thought that kombucha would be better to identify and visualize, specifically the changing of the color of the liquid as time passes.

- seconds - bubbles floating to the top
- minutes - the liquid gets lighter as minutes pass 
- hours - changing of the background from day to night
- sun to moon
